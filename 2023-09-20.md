Somehow I forgot to do this for the past two days. Sure am glad that I started early! Looks like i'll have just enough time left to complete this journaling adventure. I'm currently hopeful that my first game studio project is fun.
And, just to add. I am starting to get pretty deep in the development of my game studio game, and I'm starting to see the potential for a fun game.

This is a massive change and I will remember to put [REVISIT] in front of it.
