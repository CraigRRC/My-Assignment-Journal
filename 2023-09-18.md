Another day, another git journaling entry. Today i've decided to dabble in some godot and learn some GDscript. I must say, it is easier to pick up than I initally thought it would be. I still need to investigate the physics system before I decide to make a game in Godot.

Craig from the future here. I would like to add that the 3D capabilities of Godot are currently not great for the game that I want to make, so I will likely choose unreal for this personal project.
