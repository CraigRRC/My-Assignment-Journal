Today we are getting lost in the sauce. I am trying to learn the Mirror framework for Unity so that I can assist with coding a **_Search_** button, that will search steam for a list of players that are hosting games within a given ~~region~~. I'm not 100% sure if i'll filter by region yet.

This is a change that is being made on day 2.
