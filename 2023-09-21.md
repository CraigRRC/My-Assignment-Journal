The final entry. What a ride it has been. We've been through many ups and downs, lefts and rights. But alas, we must bid adieu.

Alas! I am back once again because I need to make two changes to this document and ensure that I write [REVISIT] at the beginning of my commit message. Looks like i've made a couple additional lines. That will count for 2 changes!
